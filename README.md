## Contributing
Thank you to my many classmates in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive for helping me talk through my logic.

Thank you to my good friend Luke Kelly for coming up with the idea to have Rack City play when Trump wins and 007 when Putin wins. That was genius. 

## Approach Taken
I was really struggling with my pseudo coding before. I understood the theory, but I did not properly impliment it. For this I knew I had to fix that problem and I really pseudo coded this out or else I would not be able to get it done. In my pseudo code I broke down goals for Thursday and Friday. My goal was to hit MVP by Friday. On Friday I realized I had to create my game in classes, so I decided to finish my game without classes, then on Saturday to impliment classes, giving myself one day to stylize my game. This was incredibly helpful as it gave me clear goals and timeframes and enough time to handle any issues that would arise.  

I also referenced Drake Four many times to see how he worked through issues, however I found that I wrote my code totally differently. 

I also consulted the Tic Tac Toe second pass many times and my win logic is based on that.

## Game Screenshots
Once a winner is found, the game alert comes up. Once the player presses okay it triggers the Make It Rain library and the song.

This is the large photo of my wireframe. I also have smaller photos that are easier for mobile reading in the prep/wireframe folder.

## MVP
- Create a game where when you click on a column, the player goes to the bottom most cell in the column.
- Get it to switch players.
- Create function to show what player won.
- At first I wanted an H2 to say who's turn it is and who won, but then I decided to do an alert so it could trigger the Make It Rain and the song.

## Unsolved Problems
- I would like to have Putin and Trump drop down.
- I'm not happy with how the images look. I would like to get a friend to create better images.
