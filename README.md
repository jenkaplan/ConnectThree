## Approach Taken
I was really struggling with my pseudo coding before. I understood the theory, but I did not properly impliment it. For this I knew I had to fix that problem and I really pseudo coded it out. In my pseudo code I broke down goals for Thursday and Friday. My goal was to hit MVP by Friday. On Friday I realized I had to create my game in classes, so I decided to finish my game without classes, then on Saturday to impliment classes, giving myself one day to stylize my game. This was incredibly helpful as it gave me clear goals and timeframes and enough time to handle any issues that would arise.  

I also referenced Drake Four many times to see how he worked through issues, however I found that I wrote my code totally differently. 

I also consulted the Tic Tac Toe second pass many times and my win logic is based on that.

## Unsolved Problems
-I would really like a song to play when the winner is found.
-Have the game stop once a winner is found.
-Have Putin and Trump drop down.
