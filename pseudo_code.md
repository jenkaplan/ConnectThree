#Pseudo Code for Connect Two
##board.js
-set up booleans to check if the cell is full

##game.js
-add click event to each column
-upon click, have the piece slide down to the bottom most empty cell
-set cell as filled, possibly turn boolean to false or add to an array

##app.js
-create winning logic
-when winner have it display an alert saying who won

##ideas to pursue after MVP
-display winner in H2 instead of alert
-have Trump v Putin heads slide down
-create a connect 4 instead of a connect 2
-use make it rain when a winner is found
-let player select user
